## 1. Overview

Play history records recently played songs separately per "playback context", addressing songloft-org/songloft#333: the client has only one global playback queue, so after switching playlists and switching back, the original playlist's "where did I leave off" is lost and playback can only restart from the first song or a random one.

With history archived per context, users can open the history panel on a playlist / artist / album page and continue from the song they last listened to.

Key points:

- **Not limited to playlists**: artists, albums and all other facet dimensions are supported too
- **Deduplicated by song within a context**: replaying only refreshes the timestamp and increments `play_count`
- **At most 50 entries per context**, so the query endpoint is not paginated
- Entries are written **as a side effect** of the playback-reporting endpoint `POST /songs/{id}/played` when `type=play`; the client needs no extra request

---

## 2. Playback Context

A context is identified by the `context_type` + `context_key` pair:

| context_type | context_key | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `playlist` | Playlist ID | `("playlist", "3")` |
| `artist` | Artist name | `("artist", "Jay Chou")` |
| `album` | Album name | `("album", "Fantasy")` |
| `genre` | Genre | `("genre", "Pop")` |
| `year` | Year | `("year", "2005")` |
| `decade` | Decade start year | `("decade", "2000")` |
| `language` | Language | `("language", "Mandarin")` |
| `style` | Style | `("style", "R&B")` |

Apart from `playlist`, all values come from the song facet dimensions (`songFacetColumn` in `internal/database/filters.go`) -- **no separate enum is defined**. An unsupported `context_type` always returns 400.

**`context_key` is a query parameter rather than a path parameter**: artist / album names may contain `/`, `%` and similar characters, which would create encoding ambiguity in a URL path (the frontend router puts facet values in the query for the same reason).

> The flat library list (a keyword + type filter combination) does not form a stable context, so the client passes no context there and no history is recorded.

## 3. Endpoints

### 3.1 GET /play-history -- Query play history

Returns recently played songs within the given context, ordered by last-played time descending, including **full song details**.

- **Authentication**: Bearer Token
- **Query parameters**:
  - `context_type` (string, required)
  - `context_key` (string, required)
  - `limit` (int, optional, defaults to 50, capped at 50)
- **200**:

```json
{
  "items": [
    {
      "song": { "id": 2, "title": "晴天", "artist": "周杰伦", "...": "full Song object" },
      "played_at": "2026-07-30T08:50:44+08:00",
      "play_count": 1
    }
  ],
  "total": 1
}
```

- **400**: unsupported `context_type` or missing `context_key` | **500**: Server error

Returning the full `Song` is deliberate: when the client starts playback from a history entry, it can use this object as the first queue item and start playing with **zero extra requests** (see [Design Notes](#4-design-notes)).

### 3.2 DELETE /play-history -- Clear play history

Deletes all entries within the given context. Returns `deleted: 0` when the context had no entries, which is not treated as an error.

- **Authentication**: Bearer Token
- **Query parameters**: `context_type` (required), `context_key` (required)
- **200**: `{"deleted": 3}`
- **400**: Invalid parameters | **500**: Server error

### 3.3 DELETE /play-history/entry -- Remove a single entry

Removes one song's entry from the given context. Typical use: clearing entries that have been removed from the playlist and show as stale in the history panel.

- **Authentication**: Bearer Token
- **Query parameters**: `context_type` (required), `context_key` (required), `song_id` (int, required)
- **204**: Deleted, no content
- **400**: Invalid parameters | **404**: No entry for that song in this context | **500**: Server error

### 3.4 Writing: POST /api/v1/songs/{id}/played

Play history has no dedicated write endpoint; it hooks into the existing playback-reporting endpoint (see [Song API](歌曲%20API.md)). Two optional parameters are added alongside `source` / `type`:

| Parameter | Description |
|---|---|
| `context_type` | Playback context type; only effective when `type=play` |
| `context_key` | Playback context identifier; only effective when `type=play` |

When both are present and valid, the song is additionally written to that context's play history. **A write failure is only logged and the status code is always 204**, so playback is never affected.

**Only `type=play` is persisted**:

- `type=play` fires after playback succeeds on the client, covering both manual selection and auto-advance -- exactly the "where did I leave off" semantics
- `type=finish` is redundant information about the same song
- `type=skip` reports the **previous** song, and by then the client's context may already have switched to a new playlist, which would file the previous song under the wrong context

The client also omits the context for `finish` / `skip`, and the backend only accepts `play` -- a deliberate double safeguard.

## 4. Design Notes

### Deduplication and trimming

Deduplication relies on the database constraint `UNIQUE(context_type, context_key, song_id)` plus an upsert (`ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE` refreshes `played_at` and increments `play_count`) rather than application-level lookups.

The cap `services.MaxPlayHistoryPerContext = 50` is a Go constant rather than a config item (making it configurable would require yet another settings endpoint, which is not worth it). The insert and the trim run in the **same transaction** (`db.RunInTx`) so a mid-way failure cannot leave excess rows.

The trim SQL uses `id NOT IN (... ORDER BY played_at DESC, id DESC LIMIT ?)`: `played_at` has second-level precision and will collide, so `id DESC` provides a deterministic tie-breaker.

### Cleanup semantics

| Scenario | Behavior |
|---|---|
| Song deleted from the library | The `song_id` foreign key `ON DELETE CASCADE` cleans up automatically |
| Playlist deleted | `context_key` is TEXT, so no foreign key to `playlists` is possible; `PlaylistService` explicitly calls `ClearByPlaylist`. **Batch deletion only clears playlists that were actually removed** -- built-in playlists (Favorites / Radio Favorites) are never deleted, so their history must survive |
| Song removed from a playlist but still in the library | The entry is **kept** (history is history). The client reports it as stale when it cannot be located during playback |
| Artist / album renamed | Entries under the old key become stale but are kept; handled as above |

### Client playback strategy: why no "track number" is returned

An intuitive design would have the endpoint return the song's index within the context so the client could page directly to it. **This API deliberately does not**, because such an index is unreliable for facet dimensions:

Facet song lists go through `GET /songs?artist=X`, whose default ordering is `added_at DESC`. But `added_at` is a second-precision `DATETIME`, and a bulk scan import inserts sequentially inside a single transaction, so hundreds or thousands of songs end up with **identical** `added_at` values. `applyOrder` emits a single-column `ORDER BY` with **no `id` tie-breaker**, so the index is mathematically indeterminate -- starting playback from it would play the wrong song.

The client instead uses "play the first song immediately, then fill the queue circularly in the background":

1. Use the full `Song` carried by the history entry as the queue and start playing immediately (**zero extra requests**)
2. In the background, fetch the ordered ID list for that context (`GET /playlists/{id}/song-ids` for playlists, `GET /songs/ids` for facets) and locate it via `indexOf`
3. Append "everything after the target song", then wrap around and append "from the start of the context up to the target song", producing the rotated queue `[target, after…, beginning…before]`
4. If `indexOf` fails, the song is no longer in this context: notify the user and fill the whole context from the beginning

This way playlists and every facet dimension share **exactly the same code path**, the first note plays with zero delay, and nothing depends on an unstable index.
