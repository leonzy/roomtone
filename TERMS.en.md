Welcome to Roomtone. Please read the following agreement carefully before using this software. By using this software, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agreed to be bound by this agreement.

## 1. Service Description

Roomtone is an open-source, self-hosted local music server software released under the Apache-2.0 license. It allows users to deploy a music management and playback service on their own devices.

- **Self-hosted mode**: Users deploy the server themselves; all data is stored entirely on the user's own devices.
- **Local mode (Bundle)**: The Go backend runs embedded within the client; all data is stored locally.

## 2. User Conduct
